# Compression Library

This library implements various compression algorithms for efficient data compression. Currently supported algorithms:

- CPACK: A simple compression algorithm that identifies and compresses zero patterns
- BDI (Base-Delta-Immediate): Compression based on value similarities
- FPC (Frequent Pattern Compression): Compression based on common data patterns
